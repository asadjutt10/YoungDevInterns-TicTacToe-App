During my internship at YoungDevInterns, I completed my first task of developing a game app using Kotlin for the backend and XML for the frontend. 
It was a great learning experience as I got hands-on practice in both designing the interface and managing the logic of the game.
Working on this project helped me strengthen my skills in Android development and better understand how to integrate UI components with backend functionalities.
